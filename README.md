# kettle.js

A rapid, bottom-up approach to developing Backbone views.

## Features

* Efficient and automatic view rendering. No need for a render method, views will automatically render based on the events you define.
* Custom two-way data binding. Easily tie a DOM element to a model attribute.
* Automatic sub-view management. Automatically handle add, remove, reset and sort events on a collection.
* The bottom-up, element-first approach greatly simplifies the design of most views
